      <h3>Story</h3>
      <p>
        Inlightened was founded in 2019 by Shelli Pavone and Michelle Higginson in Boston, Massachusetts. We were acquired by LocumTenens.com, part of the Jackson Healthcare® family of companies, in August of 2023, and continue to operate as an independent entity. Inlightened has experienced significant growth in recent years, but one thing remains consistent: We are committed to changing the way healthcare innovation works — or historically hasn’t worked — by prioritizing diversity, transparency, and quality.
